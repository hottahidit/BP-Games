# Project Overview
This was initially for my KS3 Ebaccalaureate. I am now just adding some random games as a side project. I have hosted three games so far: Minesweeper, Snake, Lights Out and Brick Breaker. I only used ChatGPT for research purposes. The Discontiuned folder was initially for logic for the games, but is discontinued now because it was really just useless. You can try this(I will have to approve you) at: hottahidit.pythonanywhere.com

# Installation and running the app
This project uses flask, and termcolor is optional. First do <code>git clone https://github.com/hottahidit/BP-Games.git</code>, to install the app. Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), then download the packages using <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> while you are in the main directory. To run the app, do <code>python3 app.py</code>. Enjoy!

##
P.S. This is not finished so I may change things in the future, like adding more games, changing mechanics or maybe reworking code. I will probably also delete the Discontinued folder in the future. I will try to fix all that I can, but I might not be able to fix all of it. I will also add images of all the apps in the future.
