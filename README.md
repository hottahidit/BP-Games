# Project Overview
This was initially for my KS3 Ebaccalaureate. I am now just adding some random games as a side project. I have hosted three games so far: Minesweeper, Lights Out and Brick Breaker. I only used ChatGPT for research purposes. 

# Installation and running the app
This project uses flask, and termcolor is optional. First do <code>git clone https://github.com/hottahidit/BP-Games.git</code>, to install the app. Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), then download the packages using <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> while you are in the main directory. To run the app, do <code>python3 app.py</code>. Enjoy!

##
P.S. This is not finished so I may change things in the future, like adding more games, changing mechanics or maybe reworking code. I will try to fix all that I can, but I might not be able to fix all of it. I will also add images of all the apps in the future.
